      <description>The Mountain Motorcycle Association of Arizona (MMAA) was established in 2007 and is a non-profit 501(c)(4) organization. We are dedicated to being an independent advocate for the advancement of motorcycling and the lifestyle associated with it. We actively get involved with issues that affect motorcyclistsâ€™ rights, especially in Arizona, and also promote motorcycle safety. However, our main objective (simply put) is to get out and ride! To do that, we organize and participate in many activities throughout the year that encourages our members to get out on their bikes and enjoy the beautiful area in which we live.</description>

      <description>We are fortunate to call the beautiful White Mountains of Arizona our home, and we want to contribute back to the communities in which we belong. To do that, we host and participate in various events throughout the calendar year.
In the summer we host the Family Advocacy Run that helps to support the center located in Show Low, AZ. Other events help support various local Veterans organizations and raise funds for our annual Toy Drive that provide Christmas toys to needy kids in Show Low, Vernon, Heber-Overgaard, and other White Mountain areas.</description>

      <description>An important part of being a MMAA member is to learn and practice new methods and techniques for improving motorcycle safety. Improve slow speed turning, counter steering, learn proper group formation riding, hand signals, braking techniques, etc. Some of our members have decades of riding experience and willingly share their knowledge to help make you a better rider!</description>
