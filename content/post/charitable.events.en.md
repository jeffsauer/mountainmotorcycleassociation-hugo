We are fortunate to call the beautiful White Mountains of Arizona our home, and we want to contribute back to the communities in which we belong. To do that, we host and participate in various events throughout the calendar year.

In the summer we host the Family Advocacy Run that helps to support the center located in Show Low, AZ. Other events help support various local Veterans organizations and raise funds for our annual Toy Drive that provide Christmas toys to needy kids in Show Low, Vernon, Heber-Overgaard, and other White Mountain areas. 

In the spring of 2020, we will become the primary host and organizer for the Carriage House Run. Beginning its 10th year, this is a unique opportunity to meet the wonderful residents at the Carriage House assisted living facility located in Snowflake, Az.

To see what upcoming events are scheduled, please visit our [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1624306234485352/) page.
