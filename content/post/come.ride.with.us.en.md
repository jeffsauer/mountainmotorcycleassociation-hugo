The Mountain Motorcycle Association of Arizona (MMAA) was established in 2007 and is a non-profit 501(c)(4) organization. We are dedicated to being an independent advocate for the advancement of motorcycling and the lifestyle associated with it. We actively get involved with issues that affect motorcyclistsâ€™ rights, especially in Arizona, and also promote motorcycle safety. However, our main objective (simply put) is to get out and ride! To do that, we organize and participate in many activities throughout the year that encourages our members to get out on their bikes and enjoy the beautiful area in which we live.
